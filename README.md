# International Robotics Challenge

Since 1998, with it’s motto of spreading science and technology, Techfest has evolved to give an International platform to all the tech-enthusiasts for proving their calibre in science and technology.
The zonal qualifying rounds for the competition will be held in various countries, whose winning entries will be invited to compete in the IRC Grand Finale to be held at Techfest 2018-19, IIT Bombay.

**Manual holonomic three wheeled bot:**

Capable of lifting boxes with a custom arm mechanism. Equipped with a dart shooting mechanism with laser targeting. Electronics include an Arduino mega, Hercules motor drivers, buck converters, usb host-shield, red_gear transmitter and a red_gear controller.
The Manual Bot was taken for the competition International Robotics Challenge organised by Techfest, IIT Bombay 2018 from 14th December to 16th December.

**Automatic holonomic three wheeled bot:**

Capable of following walls and solving a maze given the shortest path. Equipped with a Raspberry Pi 3, Arduino Nano, Pololu ddrv8 motor driver, Pololu Minimu(Gyroscope + Magnetometer), three ultrasonic sensors.  Serial communication between the arduino and the raspberry pi has been used to seamlessly transfer data from the minimu to the raspberry pi for processing. Motor control and ultrasonic sensor control  is being done on the raspberry pi itself. 
The Automatic Bot was taken for the competition International Robotics Challenge organised by Techfest, IIT Bombay 2018 from 14th December to 16th December.
